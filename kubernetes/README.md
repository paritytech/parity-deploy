## [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) Pod specifications

[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) is a container orchestration system from Google. There are two files in the kubernetes directory that can be used with [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) to deploy to a kubernetes cluster
 One of them describes a pod that will run parity in dev mode, and the other defines a service which will configure a load balanced external IP address to reach the service. See the yaml files for more details.
